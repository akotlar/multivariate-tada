 Disorder 0 has a prev = 0.02 and thres = 2.0541885887219 

 Disorder 1 has a prev = 0.02 and thres = 2.0541885887219 

 h2[0] = 0.4  h2[1] =0.4   rho = 0.2 

 Stupid_sum[0] = 3.37270833483672e-09   and stupid_sum[1] = 1.39856837222396e-08 

 Before normalization total variances were 0.643773803035451 and 0.628256921471622 

Normalizing by 0.788248849683376

 For disorder 0 we expected a prevalence of 0.02 and got 0.029015 with 5803 out of 200000

 Genetic mean liability  = 7.68640706638735e-17 Genetic Variance in Liabilty = 0.642588641287725
 Residual mean liability  = 0.000393096667177541 Residual Variance in Liabilty = 0.968785620281223
 Total mean liability  = -8.36555061334288e-16 Total Variance in Liabilty = 1.00017377898826

Normalizing by 0.79792368163043

 For disorder 1 we expected a prevalence of 0.02 and got 0.028425 with 5685 out of 200000

 Genetic mean liability  = -1.86512083555357e-15 Genetic Variance in Liabilty = 0.630414627559051
